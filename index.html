    <h3>Professional Profile</h3>
    I am currently enrolled as a Mechanical Engineering student at Politecnico di Torino.<br>
    I'm a very communicative person, used to team work, ready to go through challenges ahead and always keep learning.<br>
    When I was younger my passion was sports and music. I've participated in international championships as a judo player and played the drums with local bands through my youth.<br>
    After I graduated from High School at 17, my interest in logic and science made myself pursue my engineer carrer.<br>
    My major interests are in Programming and BioMechanics fields.

            <li>In Oficina do Espresso the main job was fixing coffe machines, and for the fisrt time I could put in practice my skills as mechanical engineer.<br>
            Dealing with engines, pumps and heaters was the everyday drill. This internship helped me get a clearer view of mechanic, hydraulic and thermal sistems, and how they work togheter.</li>

            <li>My job consisted in finding ways to improve time, cost and workers experience of the cars production chain at Final Assembly sector of the FCA factory.<br>
            I participated in 2 projects that were implemented in the supply chain:
            <ul>
              <li>The first was called Pick to Light, and consisted in creating a system of small lights appended to each car part. Each light would glow at the right time and order when the worker should use them.</li>
              <li>The second was the programming of a LD-60/90 Omron AMR robot. The robot's goal was to substitute every delivery that was beeing made by man inside the factory.</li>
