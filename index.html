    <h3>Professional Profile</h3>
    I am currently enrolled as a Mechanical Engineering student at Politecnico di Torino.<br>
    Solving problems and helping people is my drive! I'm a very communicative person, used to team work, ready to go through all challenges ahead and always keep learning.<br>
    When I was younger my passion was sports and music. I've competed in international championships as a judo fighter and played the drums with local bands through my whole youth.<br>
    After I graduated from High School at 17, my interest in logic and science grew and I started pursuing my goal to become an engineer.<br>
    My biggest interests are in Programming and BioMechanics fields.

    <h3>Internship Experiences</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintenance and Improvement of the supply chain at <a href="https://www.stellantis.com/it">Fiat Chrisler Automobiles</a> factory Betim, MG.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>My job consisted in finding ways to improve time, cost and workers experience of the cars production chain at Final Assembly sector of the FCA factory.<br>
        I participated in 2 projects that were implemented in the supply chain:
        <ul>
          <li>The first was called Pick to Light, and consisted in creating a system of small lights appended to each car part. Each light would glow at the right time and order when the worker should use them.</li>
          <li>The second was the programming of a LD-60/90 Omron AMR robot. The robot's goal was to substitute every delivery that was beeing made by man inside the factory.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Stock Market companies Analysis at <a href="https://afinvest.com.br/">AF Invest</a>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>During my time in AF Invest I was able to learn investing core concepts and strategies with the best variable income managers.<br>
        Besides the "watching and learning" I was responsible for creating a DataBase with the information acquired of all the companies in our watchlist.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Repair and Maintenance at <a href="https://www.oficinadoespresso.com/">Oficina do Espresso</a>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In Oficina do Espresso the main job was fixing coffe machines, and for the fisrt time I could put in practice my skills as mechanical engineer.<br>
        Dealing with engines, pumps and heaters was the everyday drill. This internship helped me get a clearer view of mechanic, hydraulic and thermal sistems, and how they work togheter.</li>
